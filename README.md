A game for CMP_SC 4610 final project, inspired by original Mario type platforming games. Built in Unity and C++

# Setting up for development
## Install Unity
To work on this game you should [download Unity here](https://unity.com/)
1. Click 'get started' after you've opened the link.
2. Click the tab for Individual and click 'get started' for a personal account. You shouldn't need to make a student account. Or, sign in if you already have an account
3. Click 'start here' for First-Time users. Download and install the installer.
4. You can make a new project and run trough the tutorial if you like.

## Clone the repository and open it in Unity 
Either use github the way you want, or follow these instructions for the desktop github app.
1. Go [download the desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) for github and install it.
2. Sign in with your account
3. On the app, click clone repository, then URL.
4. On this page, click the green clone or download button near the top right and copy the URL.
5. Paste into the github app clone repository area, put it any folder you want I guess.
6. You should now be able to start Unity and open the project.
* Note: there might be some issue that says something about supporting windows and switching target to mac, or vice versa, just hit yes. It might take a second then the project should be able to be loaded.


## Committing changes
This will probably only work once you've been added as a collaborator, so make sure to do that.
If you try to push changes when you're not a collaborator, it will probably ask if you want to make a fork, so in that case something is messed up.
